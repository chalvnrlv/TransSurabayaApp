## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is built with a modern tech stack and follows Google's recommended architecture for Android development.

### Tech Stack

* **Language**: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (100% Kotlin)
* **UI Toolkit**: [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
* **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
* **Navigation**: [Jetpack Navigation for Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation)
* **Asynchronous Programming**: [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) & [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html)
* **Database**: [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for local data persistence
* **Dependency Injection**: Manual (ViewModelFactory)
* **QR Code Generation**: [ZXing (Zebra Crossing)](https://github.com/zxing/zxing)

### Architecture

The application follows a clean MVVM architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and a scalable, maintainable codebase.

* **UI Layer (View)**: Composable functions (`HomeScreen`, `MapScreen`, etc.) that observe the ViewModel.
* **ViewModel Layer**: `TransSurabayaViewModel` holds and manages UI-related data and business logic. It exposes data via `State` and `Flow`.
* **Data Layer (Model)**: The `TransSurabayaRepository` is the single source of truth. It abstracts data sources, currently handling the local Room database.
